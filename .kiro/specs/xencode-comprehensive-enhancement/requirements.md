## Introduction

This specification defines the comprehensive enhancement of Xencode, transforming it from a functional offline-first AI coding assistant into the world's premier local development tool. The enhancement encompasses completing Phase 3 features, establishing robust testing infrastructure, and laying the foundation for Phases 4-7 to achieve untouchable market positionâ€”faster than Cursor, more collaborative than Replit, with fortress-level privacy through zero-cloud architecture.

## Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions

- Python 3.12+ environment with pip package management
- Minimum 8GB RAM for optimal model performance
- Internet connectivity for initial setup and plugin marketplace access
- Git version control system is available for workspace management

### Constraints
- Must maintain offline-first architecture (no cloud dependencies for core functionality)
- Limited to Python ecosystem for core components (plugins may use other languages)
- SQLite database size limited to 10GB per workspace for performance
- Plugin execution sandboxed with 2GB memory limit per plugin
- JWT token expiration maximum 24 hours for security compliance
