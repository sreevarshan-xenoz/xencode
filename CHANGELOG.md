## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `xencode worktree list | add <path> [<branch>] | remove <path>` (D3-04) over the D3-01 helpers; omitted branch lets git name the new branch after the directory, dirty removals stay refused by git and the main checkout is never removable
- Background tasks can run in another directory (D3-03): `TaskManager::start_with_cwd`, an optional `cwd` on the `background_start` tool (echoed back as `in <dir>` in the result), and the context bundle's git summary now lists extra git worktrees with branch and dirty markers
- Worktree panel (`Ctrl+O` or Feature Navigator, D3-02): lists git worktrees with branch, short HEAD and dirty marker (★ main / ⚡ dirty / ◯ clean), `a` walks a two-stage add prompt (path → branch), `d` removes via y/N confirm — the main worktree is refused before any git call and dirty worktrees stay protected by git's own guard; `r` refreshes
- Git worktree helpers (`xencode-context-rs::worktree`, D3-01): pure `parse_worktree_list` for `git worktree list --porcelain` (spaces in paths, detached/locked/prunable/bare) plus explicit-arg `worktree_list`/`worktree_add`/`worktree_remove` shells sharing `gitinfo`'s error reporting
- `xencode tasks` CLI (D2-02): file-backed background-task registry (`xencode-core-rs::tasks_file`) shared through `.xencode/tasks/` — `list [--json]`, `start <cmd> [--name]`, `poll <id> [--lines]`, `stop <id>`, `rm <id>`; tasks survive the starting process (EXIT-trap wrapper records exit codes, output captured to `<id>.out`), status is derived on read from exit file + killed flag + `/proc` liveness, and `rm` refuses still-running tasks
- Background Tasks panel (`Ctrl+K` or Feature Navigator, D2-01): live registry view with per-status colored rows (running / exited / killed), Enter → scrollable output detail for the selected task, `x` stop and `d` remove dispatched through the event channel so keys never block, wheel + resize clamping included
- Agentic background-task tool loop in chat (D1-02): the model can call `background_start` / `background_poll` / `background_stop` (schemas in `xencode-providers-rs::background_tools`), executed client-side against the shared task registry with up to 8 tool rounds per turn; each call and result echoes into chat as a `⚙` system line
- Background task registry (`xencode-core-rs::tasks`, D1-01): pure `TaskStore`/`TaskRecord` (status Running/Exited(code)/Killed, 500-line capped output tail) plus a tokio-backed `TaskManager` that spawns commands through `sh -c`, drains stdout+stderr without blocking polls, and refuses to remove or drop a still-running task's child process
- Chat input history & autocomplete: Alt+Up/Down recalls sent prompts (draft stashed and restored, adjacent duplicates skipped), Tab completes slash commands — `/init`, `/ctx`, `/advise`, `/bytebot` — with the command list surfaced in the help overlay and as a toast on a lone `/` (Milestone E5)
- Multiline chat input: the input box is now a real text area — Enter sends, Alt+Enter (or Ctrl+J) inserts a newline, arrows move inside multi-line drafts (Milestone E5)
- `light` TUI theme (8th palette), selectable via Settings ←/→ or `active_theme = "light"` in config; theme cycling now runs through one shared `THEME_NAMES` list instead of three duplicated arrays, and the settings Theme row shows dots for all themes (Milestone E4)

### Changed
- Docs close-out (Milestone E7): QUICK_START/USER_MANUAL TUI sections rewritten against the real keymap — removed the never-existing `/help` `/models` `/model` `/clear` `/exit` slash commands, documented the help overlay, multiline input, history recall and Tab completion; README panel count corrected to 21; the unbound `h:refresh` Provider Health status hint now shows the working `Ctrl+H`
- TUI key handling restructured into a new `keymap.rs`: global Ctrl chord table + per-focus handlers replace the ~900-line `match` in the event loop. Panels now own their letter keys — SecurityAuditor `s` (sort toggle) and CustomModels `s` (save profile) work again instead of opening Settings — and `j`/`k` are typable in every text field (commit message, ByteBot command, settings URL edit); ByteBot history recall is ↑ only (E6-01)
- Every panel color renders through new semantic `ThemeColors` slots (`success`/`warning`/`danger`/`info`/`accent_secondary`): 63 hardcoded ANSI constants in the renderer are gone, so themes can actually restyle severities, diffs and status badges (Milestone E4)
- Body panel layout has one source of truth: `ui::body_chunks` feeds both the renderer and mouse focus hit-testing (`ui::body_hit_test`), replacing the duplicated 20%/70% magic numbers in the event loop (Milestone E4)
- Settings panel navigation is bound to a real row list: new `focus::SETTINGS_ROWS` feeds the panel labels, section ranges, and the ↑↓/wheel bounds, replacing the hardcoded `14` (Milestone E4)
- Removed legacy Node wrapper (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `bin/xencode.js`) and completed-migration docs (`docs/RUST_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`, `docs/RUST_MIGRATION_STATUS.md`); the product is Rust-only under `rust/`.

### Added
- TUI toast notification layer: file-watch warnings now surface as transient top-right overlays (6s TTL, deduped) instead of polluting chat history as fake system lines (Milestone E3)
- TUI keybinding help overlay (`?`/`F1`): modal panel-aware keymap generated from the real key handler, with scroll and status-bar discoverability (Milestone E3)
- TUI markdown rendering for assistant chat: fenced code blocks with language labels (correct even mid-stream), headings, bullets/ordered lists, block quotes, rules, inline `code`/**bold**/*italic* (Milestone E3)
- Image input pipeline: magic-byte format detect, header dimensions, data URLs (`analysis-rs` images module), `analyze` CLI inventory, `MessageContent` parts with per-backend rendering (Ollama/Anthropic/Gemini/OpenAI-compatible), TUI attach sends images as message parts
- Web extraction for research: timeout/capped fetch with content-type gate, pure HTML→text (scripts/styles stripped, entities decoded), `FetchedPage` record, `fetch` CLI subcommand
- PR-level diff triage: rename-aware numstat parsing and capped per-file diffs (`gitinfo`), `review` CLI command with working-tree analysis and documented JSON
- Document parsing into context: PDF (pdf-extract) and DOCX (zip + w:t runs) text extraction with size/char caps, TUI attach inlines extracted text with explicit skip notes
- Workspace RBAC + audit log: Admin-gated membership, self-leave, last-admin guard, sequenced audit events including denials
- TUI PR review dashboard: per-file diff browsing (`Ctrl+Y`, Feature Navigator entry) over rename-aware numstat + capped diffs, base toggle HEAD<->main, scrollable diff pane

### Fixed
- TUI: every scroll offset (chat, code review, provider health, security findings, help overlay) is re-clamped when the terminal resizes, so shrinking then growing back no longer re-exposes stale scroll-past-the-end blank space; render and clamp now share one set of line builders (E6-02)
- TUI: text fields (git commit message, ByteBot command, settings URL edit) are now fully typable — space and the letters `i / m s q ?` no longer trigger shortcuts while typing; Left arrow moves the cursor instead of deleting a character; VoiceInterface `m` mute reachable again (E2-06)
- TUI (Milestone E2): ByteBot Enter executes the typed command instead of clobbering it with history; `git commit` runs off the UI thread with the result reported as a chat line; dead `FocusArea::Terminal` removed; unused `file_scroll_offset` deleted; provider-health/security/code-review scroll clamped (no more blank render past the end) and CodeReview output made scrollable; mouse wheel wired for Settings/ModelSelector/CustomModels/CodeReview
- Docs: corrected stale crate/test counts (`NEXT_PLAN.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md` said 331 tests; real count verified at 421/13 crates via `cargo test --workspace`), removed Python-era fiction from `docs/USER_MANUAL.md` and `docs/INSTALL_MANUAL.md` (dead `xencode.sh`/pip instructions, missing HTML reference)
- Context budget: state/git tiers emitted only when margin-admitted; tail truncation hard-cuts single-line overflow; preview compaction flag only when content dropped
- Symbol graph: brace-group import expansion and crate-root fallback for 2018 paths; broken-import checks per anchored pair
- TUI: no silent attachment drops, exact watch-dedup, kind|path watch tokens, honest /advise counts, visible save errors
- CLI: full-tree analyze with skip counts and documented dir JSON schema, scan --format json, fetch text cap, strict --json-schema
- Providers: request timeouts (total for single-shot, time-to-first-token for streams), Gemini key via header, NXDOMAIN-only DNS retry direction, tool-call demux for index-less fragments
- Cache: deterministic LRU sequence counter (fixes intermittent eviction flakes), float-tolerant legacy seeding test
- Real-time workspace watcher with debounced proactive warnings for tracked/attached/open files
- Repository insights: dependency cycles, hub files, orphans, broken imports, affected dependents (`advise` module + `/advise` TUI command with dependents in watch warnings)
- Rust CI gates (fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, full workspace suite), Rust binary GitHub Releases, Rust Docker/runtime and installers
