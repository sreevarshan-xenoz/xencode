# Changelog

All notable changes to the Xencode project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Image input pipeline: magic-byte format detect, header dimensions, data URLs (`analysis-rs` images module), `analyze` CLI inventory, `MessageContent` parts with per-backend rendering (Ollama/Anthropic/Gemini/OpenAI-compatible), TUI attach sends images as message parts
- Web extraction for research: timeout/capped fetch with content-type gate, pure HTML→text (scripts/styles stripped, entities decoded), `FetchedPage` record, `fetch` CLI subcommand
- PR-level diff triage: rename-aware numstat parsing and capped per-file diffs (`gitinfo`), `review` CLI command with working-tree analysis and documented JSON
- Document parsing into context: PDF (pdf-extract) and DOCX (zip + w:t runs) text extraction with size/char caps, TUI attach inlines extracted text with explicit skip notes
- Workspace RBAC + audit log: Admin-gated membership, self-leave, last-admin guard, sequenced audit events including denials

### Fixed
- Context budget: state/git tiers emitted only when margin-admitted; tail truncation hard-cuts single-line overflow; preview compaction flag only when content dropped
- Symbol graph: brace-group import expansion and crate-root fallback for 2018 paths; broken-import checks per anchored pair
- TUI: no silent attachment drops, exact watch-dedup, kind|path watch tokens, honest /advise counts, visible save errors
- CLI: full-tree analyze with skip counts and documented dir JSON schema, scan --format json, fetch text cap, strict --json-schema
- Providers: request timeouts (total for single-shot, time-to-first-token for streams), Gemini key via header, NXDOMAIN-only DNS retry direction, tool-call demux for index-less fragments
- Cache: deterministic LRU sequence counter (fixes intermittent eviction flakes), float-tolerant legacy seeding test
- Real-time workspace watcher with debounced proactive warnings for tracked/attached/open files
- Repository insights: dependency cycles, hub files, orphans, broken imports, affected dependents (`advise` module + `/advise` TUI command with dependents in watch warnings)
- Rust CI gates (fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, full workspace suite), Rust binary GitHub Releases, Rust Docker/runtime and installers
- Enhanced Security Scanning with Bandit Integration
- Comprehensive vulnerability database with CVE patterns
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability detection
- Multi-language security analysis (Python, JavaScript, Java)
- Security report generation (summary, detailed, executive)
- Automated risk assessment and compliance scoring
- 50+ Bandit security rules with CWE mappings
- Async security scanning for performance
- Demo application for security scanning capabilities
- Comprehensive test suite (21 tests) for security features

### Removed
- Legacy Python stack: `xencode/` package, pytest suite, examples, benchmarks, deployment helpers, packaging configs, and the local venv (Rust workspace under `rust/` is the product)
- Python install paths (pip/venv/PyInstaller) from `install.sh`/`install.ps1`, the Python Dockerfile stages, and pytest/ruff/bandit CI jobs

### Enhanced
- Security analyzer with multiple scanning methods
- Pattern-based vulnerability detection
- Dependency vulnerability checking
- Security metrics calculation and reporting
- Integration with existing code analysis workflow

### Security
- Code injection detection (eval, exec, dynamic execution)
- SQL injection pattern matching
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability detection
- Path traversal security checks
- Weak cryptography identification
- Hardcoded secrets detection
- Unsafe deserialization checks
- Command injection vulnerability scanning

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-30

- Missing feature hook implementations for CLI, TUI, and API integration across core feature modules

- Release and deployment validation scripts for version consistency and deployment secrets

### Changed
- Hardened collaborative CLI async execution and TUI panel update safety in unmounted contexts
